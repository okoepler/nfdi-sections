|Concept (NFDI pragmatic label)|BFO/OBO (CAVE: there is a difference between version 2.0 & 2020 wrt object properties!)|SIO|DOLCE (DUL)|CIDOC-CRM|PIMS-II|EMMO|W3C framework (PROV, SOSA, FOAF, etc)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|location|see space|see space||?||||
|event/occurent/process/activity|occurrent and its subclasses: process & process boundary|process - A process is an entity that is identifiable only through the unfolding of time, has temporal parts, and unless otherwise specified/predicted, cannot be identified from any instant of time in which it exists.|Event, with subclasses: Process & Action|E5 Event and 26 subclasses||||
|method|not top level enough for BFO; If understood as special kind of process use obi:planned process or if understood as the "plan/instructions" of a process --&gt; iao:plan specification|if understood as a special kind of process: procedure; if understood as the "plan" behind a procedure --&gt; action specification||E7 Activity and subclasses||||
|tool|not top level enough; but obi:device might be an option, if tool here means a physical tool (material entity) used in a scientific investigation.|not defined as such, but can be defined under specialized material entity when understood as a material entity with a destinct capability||via P188 requires production tool||||
|material|material entity - A material entity is an independent continuant that has some portion of matter as proper or improper continuant part.|material entity - a physical entity that is spatially extended, exists as a whole at any point in time and has mass|Object from DOLCE could represent a weakly relation with "material entity" - Any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance. Following DOLCE Full, objects are always participating in some event (at least their own life), and are spatially located.|E18 Physical Thing and subclasses||||
|time|temporal region - parent class of temporal instant and temporal interval|time is represented as information content entites (mathmatical ones more concretely) in terms of defining a time interval and time instant|Time interval - Any Region in a dimensional space that aims at representing time.|E2 Temporal Entity and subclasses||||
|space|eigther site or one of the children of spatial region|subclasses of spatial region - A spatial region is an object contained in some region of space.||E53 Place, E92 Spacetime Volume, E94 Space Primitive or E95 Spacetime Primitive||||
|context|there is no such thing as a context in BFO; If one wants to say that a class has to be understood in a certain way according to some discursive context, one would probably have to encode it in BFO terms as having a certain bfo:role or bfo:disposition which get's reralized in some kind of bfo:process|similar to BFO SIO has no explicit concept class, but one would use a class from its attribute branch to narrow the context of an entity|Situation - A view, consistent with ('satisfying') a Description, on a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame' (i.e. a Description).|Maybe via E7 Activity?||||
|information|not top level enough; but there is iao:information content entity to represent information indempendenly from the material entity it is encoded/embedded in|information content entity - an object that requires some background knowledge or procedure to correctly interpret.||E73 Information Object subsumes all kinds of immaterial objects such as documents, plans, inscriptions...||||
|quality/attributes/characteristic|specifically dependent continuant - b is a specifically dependent continuant = Def. b is a continuant & there is some independent continuant c which is not a spatial region and which is such that b s-depends_on c at every time t during the course of bâ€™s existence.  With its subclasses: quality - a quality is a specifically dependent continuant that, in contrast to roles and dispositions, does not require any further process in order to be realized & realizable entity - To say that b is a realizable entity is to say that b is a specifically dependent continuant that inheres in some independent continuant which is not a spatial region and is of a type instances of which are realized in processes of a correlated type.|attribute - a characteristic of some entity; with the subclasses: quality - an attribute that is intrinsically associated with its bearer (or its parts), but whose presence/absence and observed/measured value may vary, realizable entity -  an attribute that is exhibited under some condition and is realized in some process|Social attribute - Any Region in a dimensional space that is used to represent some characteristic of a SocialObject, e.g. judgment values, social scalars, statistical attributes over a collection of entities, etc. Physical attribute - Physical value of a physical object, e.g. density, color, etc. Both are subclasses of Region|Maybe E13 Attribute Assignment?||||

|We'll need to search for existing mappings/alignments between the above listed TLOs/Terms in the next step.||||||||
