|DCAT|Data Catalog Vocabulary|vocabulary|W3C License|RDF|owl|reused|W3C_based|||https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DCAT||DCAT V2: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DCAT V3: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/||W3C: DCAT 3 supersedes DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2], but it does not make it obsolete. DCAT 3 maintains the DCAT namespace as its terms preserve backward compatibility with DCAT 2. DCAT 3 relaxes constraints and adds new classes and properties, but these changes do not break the definition of previous terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any new implementation is expected to adopt DCAT 3, while the existing implementations do not need to upgrade to it, unless they want to use the new features. In particular, current DCAT 2 deployments that do not overlap with the DCAT 3 new features (e.g., versioning, dataset series and inverse properties) don't need to change anything to remain in conformance with DCAT 3.|
