# Working Group Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)

The working group aims to help improve and increase hands-on adoption and practice-orientation of the results of the participating NFDI projects, where possible also by means of showcasing effective solutions, policy-, technical- and practice-based to end user communities. As part of the current activities, the section has focused on the following two service concepts: (i) FAIRness evaluation: evaluate the FAIRness level of the digital objects with FAIRness metrics, (ii) Online Reproducible Data Analysis: JupyterHub for larger binder-ready FAIR Digital Objects.
