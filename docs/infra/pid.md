# Working Group Persistent Identifiers (PID)

The aim is to develop a common strategy for the implementation and extension of community-based and broadly used PID services that is closely aligned with the needs of NFDI consortia. This will include the necessary technical & organisational measures as well as the training and educational aspects particularly around standardised and complete metadata ensuring compliance with the FAIR principles.
