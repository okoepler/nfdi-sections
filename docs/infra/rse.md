# Working Group Research Software Engineering (RSE)

The working group networks the NFDI specialist consortia in software-related aspects. It focusses on three areas: Research software, software communities and software infrastructure at NFDI. In an advisory and supportive capacity, the working group operates a central forum and establishes the necessary software ecosystem within NFDI for the professional development of software infrastructure components, which in their entirety represent an integral part of NFDI. In addition, the working group serves as an interface for NFDI to comparable European and international initiatives in order to promote the connectivity of NFDI with other infrastructures.
