# Working Group Multi-Cloud (MC)

The key objective of all NFDI consortia is to systematically register and provide data in a sustainable manner such that it can be openly and unitarily accessed on national and even international level. The foundation for such an overarching common infrastructure is built upon the concept of a federated Multi Cloud architecture that provides unified access by a federated Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure to compute and data storage resources and allows seamless higher level integration of distributed heterogeneous services and data.
