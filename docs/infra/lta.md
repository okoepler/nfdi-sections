# Working Group Long-term Access and Preservation (LTA)

The working group has the aim to identify and coordinate procedures and techniques by which data and software as bit streams and reproducible information objects can be preserved and used long term. It is composed of members from various NFDI consortia from humanities, natural and engineering sciences as well as experts from relevant infrastructures, strongly connected to the nestor competence network for long-term archiving. The close coupling of NFDI consortia to experienced partners in the area of long-term archiving ensures that on one hand the relevant state-of-the-art is present in the group and on the other hand the knowledge of data producers about creation contexts and data users can directly interact.
