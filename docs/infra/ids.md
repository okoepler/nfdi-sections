# Working Group Infrastructure and Data Security (IDS)

Scientific disciplines deal with the proper management of personal data of human data subjects that fall under the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) or other sensitive data types that require technical and organizational measures to ensure a high degree of information security. This working group “Infrastructure and Data Security” (IDS) in the NFDI Section Common Infrastructures deals with the required technical and organizational measures that need to be implemented in research infrastructure to ensure secure and lawful processing and management of personal and sensitive data.
