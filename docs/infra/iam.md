# Working Group Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The working group aims to consolidate processes, policies and architectures in order to facilitate the management of digital identities and federated access to resources within and across the NFDI consortia. For this purpose, it will be necessary to connect and expand existing and emerging IAM systems in a way that researchers from different domains and institutions are able to access the NFDI resources as easily as possible, yet in a secure manner. Interoperability is a central requirement, not only within NFDI but also regarding access to and exchange with external infrastructures like EOSC or the Life Science AAI.
