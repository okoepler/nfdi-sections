# Working Group Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)

The working group includes representatives from different NFDI consortia, with a focus on the natural science disciplines and life sciences. The working group aims to prepare and establish services to support the selection of appropriate ELN software and its implementation in the consortia, their communities and individual groups. The working group will deal with the systematic evaluation of different ELNs and their data structures. Furthermore, a platform for testing different ELN software and similar (embedded) tools will be established in order to offer permanent access to the relevant solutions and to enable a comparative view.
