# Working Group Data Management Planning (DMP)

The working group aims to coordinate the DMP activities of the NFDI consortia. In addition to the establishment of DMP tools, agreements on their coordinated further development and the harmonisation of DMP templates in terms of content, concepts for the strategic implementation of DMPs in the research workflows, training and advisory services are also being developed. Since DMPs form essential connecting or intermediate pieces of the data management workflow and cover them almost completely in terms of content breadth, we strive for partial cooperation with the other NFDI sections such as training and metadata.
