# Working Group Overall Architecture (OA)

The NFDI Overall Architecture Working Group aims to develop a shared vision and blueprint for a federated research data infrastructure across NFDI consortia. It addresses the fragmented current landscape by identifying common components and fostering cross-domain integration. The groupâ€™s objectives include defining a unifying vision, formulating a collaborative strategy, ensuring scalability and efficiency, engaging stakeholders to align needs and expectations, analyzing consortia-specific dynamics, and promoting inclusive and transparent governance.
