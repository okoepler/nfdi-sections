# Working Group Data Integration (DI)

The immense heterogeneity of scientific data and the data combination problems induced by this often prevent the derivation of new knowledge, especially in the context of interdisciplinary projects. The aim of this working group is therefore to develop and provide scalable methods for integrating data and metadata to enable easy data exchange between users and services. In particular, physical and virtual integration methods, methods for schema matching and semantic annotation as well as knowledge graphs will be considered. In addition, an architecture for the integration of scientific data is developed on the basis of concrete user stories and a first reference implementation is provided.
