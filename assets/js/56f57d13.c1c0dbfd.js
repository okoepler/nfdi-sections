The aim of this working group is therefore to develop and provide scalable methods for integrating data and metadata to enable easy data exchange between users and services. In particular, physical and virtual integration methods, methods for schema matching and semantic annotation as well as knowledge graphs will be considered. In addition, an architecture for the integration of scientific data is developed on the basis of concrete user stories and a first reference implementation is provided.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/dmp":{"id":"infra/dmp","title":"WG Data Management Planning (DMP)","description":"The working group aims to coordinate the DMP activities of the NFDI consortia. In addition to the establishment of DMP tools, agreements on their coordinated further development and the harmonisation of DMP templates in terms of content, concepts for the strategic implementation of DMPs in the research workflows, training and advisory services are also being developed. Since DMPs form essential connecting or intermediate pieces of the data management workflow and cover them almost completely in terms of content breadth, we strive for partial cooperation with the other NFDI sections such as training and metadata.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/dsai":{"id":"infra/dsai","title":"WG Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)","description":"The working group aims to help improve and increase hands-on adoption and practice-orientation of the results of the participating NFDI projects, where possible also by means of showcasing effective solutions, policy-, technical- and practice-based to end user communities.

The working group aims to prepare and establish services to support the selection of appropriate ELN software and its implementation in the consortia, their communities and individual groups. The working group will deal with the systematic evaluation of different ELNs and their data structures. Furthermore, a platform for testing different ELN software and similar (embedded) tools will be established in order to offer permanent access to the relevant solutions and to enable a comparative view.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/iam":{"id":"infra/iam","title":"WG Identity and Access Management (IAM)","description":"The working group aims to consolidate processes, policies and architectures in order to facilitate the management of digital identities and federated access to resources within and across the NFDI consortia. For this purpose, it will be necessary to connect and expand existing and emerging IAM systems in a way that researchers from different domains and institutions are able to access the NFDI resources as easily as possible, yet in a secure manner. Interoperability is a central requirement, not only within NFDI but also regarding access to and exchange with external infrastructures like EOSC or the Life Science AAI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/ids":{"id":"infra/ids","title":"WG Infrastructure and Data Security (IDS)","description":"Scientific disciplines deal with the proper management of personal data of human data subjects that fall under the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) or other sensitive data types that require technical and organizational measures to ensure a high degree of information security.

It is composed of members from various NFDI consortia from humanities, natural and engineering sciences as well as experts from relevant infrastructures, strongly connected to the nestor competence network for long-term archiving. The close coupling of NFDI consortia to experienced partners in the area of long-term archiving ensures that on one hand the relevant state-of-the-art is present in the group and on the other hand the knowledge of data producers about creation contexts and data users can directly interact.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/mc":{"id":"infra/mc","title":"WG Multi-Cloud (MC)","description":"The key objective of all NFDI consortia is to systematically register and provide data in a sustainable manner such that it can be openly and unitarily accessed on national and even international level. The foundation for such an overarching common infrastructure is built upon the concept of a federated Multi Cloud architecture that provides unified access by a federated Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure to compute and data storage resources and allows seamless higher level integration of distributed heterogeneous services and data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"infra/oa":{"id":"infra/oa","title":"WG Overall Architecture (OA)","description":"The NFDI Overall Architecture Working Group aims to develop a shared vision and blueprint for a federated research data infrastructure across NFDI consortia. It addresses the fragmented current landscape by identifying common components and fostering cross-domain integration.
